## Activity Overview 
In this activity, I created a program that validates information entered into a PSHS workshop registration system. 
The program checks whether user input satisfies specific requirements before accepting the registration. The program validates: 
- student name 
- age 
- grade level 
- email address and 
- registration code.

# Part A - Validation Requirements 
Complete the table below before writing your program. 
| Data Captured | Expected Input | Validation Type | Invalid Input Example | Validation Rule | Error Message | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---| 
| Student Name | String | Presence | "" | Must not be empty or blank | Student name is required. | 
| Age | Integer | Data Type + Range | "twelve", 24 | Must be an integer AND between 11 and 18 | "Age must be a number.", "Age must be from 11 to 18." | 
| Grade Level | Integer | Acceptable value | 6, 13 | Must belong to the list: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 | "Invalid grade level." | 
| Email Address | String | Pattern | student.pshs.edu.ph | Must contain ".edu.ph" AND the @ character | Invalid email format. |
| Registration Code | CodeString | Length | A123 | Length of the string must equal exactly 6 | "The registration code must contain exactly 6 characters." |

# Part D - Testing 
Test your program using both valid and invalid inputs. 
| Test | Input / Condition | Validation Being Tested | Expected Output | Actual Output | Result | 
|---:|---|---|---|---|---| 
| 1 | All inputs valid | Normal case | | | | 
| 2 | Blank student name | Presence | | | | 
| 3 | Age = `fourteen` | Data type | | | | 
| 4 | Age = `11` | Minimum boundary | | | | 
| 5 | Age = `18` | Maximum boundary | | | | 
| 6 | Age = `10` | Range | | | | 
| 7 | Grade Level = `13` | Acceptable value | | | | 
| 8 | Email = `studentpshs.edu.ph` | Pattern | | | | 
| 9 | Registration Code = `ABC` | Length | | | | 
| 10 | Registration Code = `CS2026` | Valid length | | | | 
Write **PASS** when the actual output matches the expected output. 
Write **FAIL** when it does not.
